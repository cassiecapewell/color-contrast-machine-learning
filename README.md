# Color Contrast
## Machine Learning with JavaScript ðŸ˜±

I have a deep interest in artificial intelligence, and wanted to see what I could do with Javascript, the programming language I know like the back of my hand.

In this full stack web application, users input an RGB color code and the algorithm detects whether the color's contrast is light or dark, which is displayed to the user along with the accuracy percentage.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, brain.js

Thanks for checking it out!
